# SON---API
Collections contain API queries to GoalsAPI and Calendarific API.

I tested these APIs by cURL.

For GoalsAPI im testing two GET requests and by one query for POST, PUT and DELETE goals
For Calendarific API i get every holidays in Poland in 2001 and every holidays in US in 2022

Unfortunately Calendarific doesn't support other requests than GET

I chose Calendarific because it has nice API documentation and is easy to use.
